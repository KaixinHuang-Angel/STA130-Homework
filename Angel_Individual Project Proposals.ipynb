    "        After that, we fit the model and interpret the coefficients. A positive β₁ suggests that as comfort level increases, the frequency of interactions with strangers also increases. The p-value for β₁ tests whether the observed relationship between comfort level and interactions is statistically significant. The R-squared value shows how much of the variance in stranger interaction frequency can be explained by comfort level.\n",

We expect a positive correlation between the participant's comfort with talking to strangers and the number of strangers they interact with.
